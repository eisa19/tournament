/*
 *  Frontend flow:
 *
 * 1. user first opens this app in the browser.
 * 2. a screen appears asking the user to send their friend their game URL to start the game.
 * 3. the user sends their friend their game URL
 * 4. the user clicks the 'start' button and waits for the other player to join.
 * 5. As soon as the other player joins, the game starts.
 *
 *
 * Other player flow:
 * 1. user gets the link sent by their friend
 * 2. user clicks on the link and it redirects to their game. If the 'host' has not yet
 *    clicked the 'start' button yet, the user will wait for when the host clicks the start button.
 *    If the host decides to leave before they click on the "start" button, the user will be notified
 *    that the host has ended the session.
 * 3. Once the host clicks the start button or the start button was already clicked on
 *    before, that's when the game starts.
 * Onboarding screen =====> Game start.
 *
 * Every time a user opens our site from the '/' path, a new game instance is automatically created
 * on the back-end. We should generate the uuid on the frontend, send the request with the uuid
 * as a part of the body of the request. If any player leaves, then the other player wins automatically.
